README for bitstring-0.0

The bitstring library provides facilities to create and parse binary strings 
as arbitrary collection of bits. It is inspired by Erlang bit syntax but is 
not a copy of it. The goal of bitstring project is to ease implementation and 
experimentation with binary protocols from Lua - especially protocols based 
on bits. The bitstring library doesn't need any modification of Lua syntax. 
It is released under the flexible BSD license. It is freely available from 
http://luaforge.net/projects/bitstring/

For detailed installation instructions see INSTALL

1. Install
./configure 
make check
sudo make install

to install on non default location use --libdir
for example 
./configure --libdir=/usr/local/lib/lua/5.1/ 

2. Usage
Verify that bitstring is on LUA_CPATH 

> require "bitstring"
> result = bitstring.pack("1:int, 3:int, 5:int, 16:int:big", 0x01, 0x04, 0xff, 0x0102)
> a, b, c, d = bitstring.unpack("1:int, 3:int, 5:int, 16:int:big")
> result = bitstring.hexdump("abcd")
> result = bitstring.hexstream("abcd")
> result = bitstring.fromhexstream("000a0b0c")
> result = bitstring.bindump("abcd")
> result = bitstring.binstream("abcd")
> result = bitstring.frombinstream("001001010001001001110010 ")
